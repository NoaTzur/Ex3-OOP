# Ex3-OOP in Python


This repository is for an exercise belong to OOP course.
in this exercise we impleneted directed and weighted Graph and its includes :

* Class that creates a graph - you can add nodes and edges manually, or from a Json files
  (an example of such files can be found in the data folder)
* Class thats includes algorithms on graph such as shortest path between 2 nodes (using Dikjstra algorithm)


## The connection between this Ex to the previous one - Ex2-OOP

In this exercise, the main idea is to compare the implementations of this Ex that written in Python, and the 
implementation thath written in Java, mostly to compare the running time.

## Comparing to networkX library in Python

In addition, we've been requested to add comparison with the networkX library of Python - an amazing library that
contains lots of options.
you can read about this library [RIGHT HERE](https://networkx.org/)

**Notice** - you can run the comparisons test by yourself ! goto -> wiki -> Comparisons page.

## List of classes:
1. DiGraph - implements GraphInterface.py Interface.
2. GraphAlgo - implements GraphAlgoInterface.py Interface.
3. node_data - implements node class, each node has its own data.
4. test_AlgoClass - unit tests for the algorithms written in GraphAlgo class.
5. test_DiGraph - unit tests for checking the functions of the graph in DiGraph class.
6. test_netWorkX - unit tests for studied the network library.
7. compares_algo - histograph that represents the differences in run time (running algorithms).
8. compares_creatingG - histograph that represents the differences in run time when building a graphs.

``` We're inviting you to look at the Wiki of this repository for more information ! ```
