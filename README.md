# Ex3-OOP in Python


This repository is for an exercise belong to OOP course.
in this exercise we impleneted directed and weighted Graph and its includes :

* Class that creates a graph - you can add nodes and edges manually, or from a Json files
  (an example of such files can be found in the data folder)
* Class thats includes algorithms on graph such as shortest path between 2 nodes (using Dikjstra algorithm)


## The connection between this Ex to the previous one - Ex2-OOP

In this exercise, the main idea is to compare the implementations of this Ex that written in Python, and the 
implementation was written in Java, mostly comparing the time running.

## Comparing to networkX library in Python

In addition, we've been requested to add comparison with the networkX library for Python - an amazing library that
contains lots of options.
you can read about this library [RIGHT HERE](https://networkx.org/)

In addition, you can run the comparisons test by yourself ! goto -> wiki -> Comparisons page.

``` We're inviting you to look at the Wiki of this repository for more information ! ```
